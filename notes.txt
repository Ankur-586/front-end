Project Idea: For this project, you can scrape data for any specific product available on Amazon and analyze its customers’ reviews. 
After scraping, you can do sentiment analysis and perform the necessary statistical analysis to draw insightful conclusions.

Recommended Web Scraping Tool: For this project, we suggest you use Beautiful Soup (Python’s open-source library) as it will allow you 
to crawl the website and extract the review from the Amazon website using HTML tags.
